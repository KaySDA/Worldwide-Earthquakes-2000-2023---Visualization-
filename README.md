# Worldwide-Earthquakes-2000-2023---Visualization-

Climate change is very real. It is happening at a greater speed than expected. We are seeing so many anomalies in nature and its patterns are changing. With rapid industrialization and depleting natural resources from its core it is very important to study the patterns of the quakes across the world. For example, Turkey recently was devastated by the high magnitude earthquake followed by shock waves and smaller jolts. Quakes causes larger destruction of material and immaterial worth. If we canâ€™t prevent a natural calamity then we might as well do something to warn people or larger audiences, if that saves a single life the objective is achieved. Hence rationale behind taking this dataset is to gain some insights into patterns, geographical behaviour, magnitude, locations, etc. This will lead us to some discoveries at the end of the project.
